🌟 **Skin Disorder Classification** 🚀  
📌 **Project Overview**  
Welcome to the Skin Disorder Classification project! This machine learning model is built to classify different types of skin disorders using patient-related features and medical indicators.

📂 **Dataset Information**  
📄 *File:* `Skin_Disease_Dataset.csv`

📊 **Features:**  
🧑‍⚕️ *Age*: Age of the patient  
🚻 *Sex*: Gender of the patient  
🦠 *Family History*: Whether there's a family history of skin disease  
🌡️ *Itching*, *Scaling*, *Redness*, *Swelling*, *Blisters*, etc.: Various clinical symptoms  
🧪 *Blood Test Results*: Relevant medical test indicators (if any)  
🎯 *Diagnosis*: Target label indicating the type of skin disorder (multi-class)

🔍 **Model Implementation**  
📜 *File:* `skindisorder_final.ipynb`

🛠️ **Steps Followed:**

🏗️ **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning, encoding, and normalizing data  
📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualization of symptoms and condition prevalence  
🤖 **Model Selection** - Training various classification algorithms  
📈 **Model Evaluation** - Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

🤖 **Models Used**  
🔹 Logistic Regression  
🔹 Decision Tree Classifier  
🔹 Random Forest Classifier  
🔹 Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
🔹 XGBoost Classifier  
🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier  
🔹 Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier  

📉 **Metrics Used**  
📌 Accuracy  
📌 Precision  
📌 Recall  
📌 F1-Score  
📌 Confusion Matrix  

🔍 **Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization**  
✅ Utilized `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for tuning hyperparameters  
✅ Employed stratified k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation  

🔑 **Key Insights**  
🩺 Certain symptoms like itching, redness, and scaling were major contributors to the diagnosis  
🔬 Ensemble models (like Random Forest and XGBoost) performed significantly better in classifying complex cases  

🎯 **Conclusion**  
This project efficiently classifies various skin disorders using multiple machine learning techniques. Ensemble models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** delivered superior performance. Key symptoms and patterns were identified, enhancing potential for early and accurate diagnosis.
